Script:

1. var foo = "bar";
2. function bar() {
3. var foo = "baz";
4. function baz(foo) {
5. foo = "bam";
6. bam = "yay";
7. }
8. baz(); 
9. }
10.bar();
11.baz();

Compilation phase: 
Firstly, in the global scope, it will register variable 'foo' and function 'bar'. 
In bar scope, variable foo and function baz gets registered.
In baz scope, foo gets registered.

Execution phase:
Execution according to the line.
In line 1, variable foo will be read and it is assigned a value called bar.
Next, in line 10, function bar will be called and executed. 
In line 3, variable foo is assigned a value called baz.
And now, in line 8, function baz will be called and executed. 
In line 4, function baz has a parameter called foo. 	
foo is assigned a value called bam in local scope.
And for bam in local scope, there is no reference and it has not been declared as a variable. So, it automatically becomes global variable.
bam is assigned a vvalue called 'yay'.

And coming to line 11, function 'baz' has already been declared in function 'bar'. And it has not been defined, so there will be a reference error.
