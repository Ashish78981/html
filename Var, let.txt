Var keyword allows us to declare a variable globally to the window or global to a function in which it has declared. 
Whereas, let keyword allows us to limit the scope of a variable to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used.

Example 1: 
function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;  // same variable!
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 2
}
In the above function, variable x is firstly declared in outer function and again it has been declared in inner function with the same name and assigned a 
different value. Now the value of variable x is overriden by the value of variable x in inner function. The value has been changed from 1 to 2.

Example 2:
function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}
In the above function, variable x is firstly declared in outer function with 'let' keyword. Again it has been declared in inner function with the same name and assigned a 
different value. Here, unlike var, variable in the inner function is different from variable in the outer function. Because, let limits the scope of a variable to
only if statement in which it has been declared.

At the top level of programs and functions, let, unlike var, does not create a property on the global object.

Example: 
function varvslet() {
  console.log(i); // i is undefined due to hoisting
  // console.log(j); // ReferenceError: j is not defined

  for( var i = 0; i < 3; i++ ) {
    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2
  };

  console.log(i); // 3
  // console.log(j); // ReferenceError: j is not defined

  for( let j = 0; j < 3; j++ ) {
    console.log(j);
  };

  console.log(i); // 3
  // console.log(j); // ReferenceError: j is not defined
}

Example 3:
Closure in Loop

let in the loop can re-binds it to each iteration of the loop, making sure to re-assign it the value from the end of the previous loop iteration, so it can be used to avoid issue with closures.

for (var i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i); // output '5' 5 times
  }, 100);  
}
After replacing var with let

// print 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
for (let i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i); // output 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 
  }, 100);  
}
