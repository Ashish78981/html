Hoisting in strict mode:
In strict mode, we need to declare a variable before it has been used. We cannot use the variable and then declare it. 
 
Example 1: 
<html>
<body>
<script>
"use strict"
x = 5.6;
document.write(x); 
</script>
</body>
</html>
In the above example, browser throws the error, because it is in strict mode.
 
Example 2:
<html>
<body>
<p>"use strict" in a function will only cause errors in that function.</p>
<script>
x = 5.6;     
strict();
function strict() {
"use strict";
var y = 6.7;  
document.write(x);
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
 
In the above example, we have not declared variable x. But it has been outside of strict mode. So, strict mode works only inside the function.
