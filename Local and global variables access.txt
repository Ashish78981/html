A function can access a variable that is declared inside it. It's because it is local to that function.
Example 1: 

<script>
function add(){
var x = 8;
document.write(x);
}
add();
</script>

A function can access a variable that is declared outside of it. It's because, a global variable can be accessed anywhere in the window..
The lifetime of a global variable depends upon the window. It lives as long as the window is open.
Whereas, local variables are created when the function is called, and deleted when the function is executed.

Example 2:

<script>
var x = 8;
function add(){
document.write(x);
}
add();
</script>
